# Introduction

Bootstrap and package your project with Angular 11 and Electron 12 (Typescript + SASS + Hot Reload) for creating Desktop applications.

Currently runs with:

- Angular v11.2.8
- Electron v12.0.2
- Electron Builder v22.10.5

With this sample, you can:

- Run your app in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
- Run your app in a production environment
- Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

/!\ Hot reload only pertains to the renderer process. The main electron process is not able to be hot reloaded, only restarted.

/!\ Angular 11.x CLI needs Node 10.13 or later to work correctly.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/toanpt/smart-gate-electron.git
```

Install dependencies with npm:

``` bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.


If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload!

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

## Use Electron / NodeJS libraries

This sample project runs in both modes (web and electron). To make this work, **you have to import your dependencies the right way**. Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of libraries has to be done when using electron / NodeJS / 3rd party libraries in renderer context (i.e. Angular).

## Use "web" 3rd party libraries (like angular, material, bootstrap, ...)

3rd party librairies used in electron's renderer process (like angular) have to be added in `devDependencies` of `package.json`. They are already added in your final package during webpack's compilation phase. Otherwise it will significantly increase the size of your final package... not so cool :(

## Browser mode

Maybe you only want to execute the application in the browser with hot reload? Just run `npm run ng:serve:web`.

## Included Commands

|Command|Description|
|--|--|
|`npm run ng:serve`| Execute the app in the browser |
|`npm run build`| Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run build:prod`| Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run electron:local`| Builds your application and start electron
|`npm run electron:build`| Builds your application and creates an app consumable based on your operating system |

**Your application is optimised. Only /dist folder and node dependencies are included in the executable.**
